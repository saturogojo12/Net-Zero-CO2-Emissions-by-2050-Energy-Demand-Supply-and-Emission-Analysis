# NET ZERO CO2 EMISSIONS BY 2050

## Overview

This analysis explores Japan's strategy to achieve net zero CO2 emissions by 2050. It covers energy demand and supply, emission scenarios, and the effectiveness of decarbonization strategies. 

## Energy Demand

According to the Energy Balance Table 2020, total final consumption is 1,10,08,801 TJ. Key sectors include:

- **Industry:** 28.6%
- **Transport:** 23.8%
- **Residential:** 16.7%
- **Commercial:** 17.7%
- **Agriculture:** 11.3%

Oil dominates the transportation, agricultural, and fishing industries, accounting for 50.4% of energy consumption. Electricity constitutes 30%, with significant use in residential, commercial, and public services. 

## Energy Supply

In 2020:
- **Oil:** 4.27 EJ
- **Coal:** 6.20 EJ

Fossil fuels account for over 88% of energy supply, while renewable sources contribute less than 9%.

## CO2 Emissions

In 2019, CO2 emissions were 301.86 Mt-C. Extrapolations suggest 69.5 Mt-C by 2050 if current trends continue. The ERIA report predicts 190 Mt-C in 2050 under the business-as-usual scenario. However, the LCET scenario, which includes an 85% reduction in fossil fuels and a 60% increase in renewables, aims for net-zero emissions.

## Net Zero Scenario

### Demand-Side Assumptions
- **Cost Increase:** Crude oil (67%), Coal (27%), LNG (34%)
- **Hydrogen Cost:** 330 JPY/kg H2 by 2050
- **Population:** 97 million by 2050
- **Energy Demand:** Significant reduction due to advancements in vehicle efficiency and expansion of electric vehicles.

### Supply-Side Assumptions
- **Nuclear Power:** Maximum generation capacity of 19 GW
- **Renewable Power:** 337.6 GW by 2050

### Carbon Capture
- **CO2 Storage Capacity:** 81.88 Mt-C
- **Technologies:** Direct Air Capture (DACCS), Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS), Post-Combustion CO2 Capture

## Net Zero Transition

By 2050:
- **CO2 Reduction from DACCS and BECCS:** 58.68 Mt-C
- **Reduction from Low-Carbon Energy Sources and Fossil Fuel Reduction:** 178.4 Mt-C
- **Remaining Reduction:** 35.85 Mt-C from energy efficiency and population decline

## Additional Policy Measures

- Focus on **environment, energy security, economic efficiency, and safety**.
- Support for **dispatchable capacity** and adaptation to renewable energy variability.
- Policies for **hydrogen importation** as a stable fossil fuel substitute.
